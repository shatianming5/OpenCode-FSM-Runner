# Optional ML dependencies for training/inference based benchmarks.
#
# NOTE:
# - Keep `requirements.txt` minimal (PyYAML + pytest) so the runner stays lightweight.
# - Install this file only when you need local 0.5B model training/inference.
#
# Example:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
